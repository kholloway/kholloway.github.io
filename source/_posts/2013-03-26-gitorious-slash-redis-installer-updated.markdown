In regards to my last post [gitorious-and-redis-service](/blog/2013/03/25/gitorious-and-the-redis-service/) I have updated my clone of the ce-installer to include the changes up to v2.4.12 and rolled all my changes from that post into the latest version.

My CE-Installer clone:
 [https://www.gitorious.org/~kholloway/gitorious/kholloways-ce-installer](https://www.gitorious.org/~kholloway/gitorious/kholloways-ce-installer)

I have requested a merge with the mainline ce-installer which is viewable at:
 [https://www.gitorious.org/gitorious/ce-installer/merge_requests/2](https://www.gitorious.org/gitorious/ce-installer/merge_requests/2)

Enjoy!
