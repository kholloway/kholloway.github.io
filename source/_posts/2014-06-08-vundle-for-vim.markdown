I have a new favorite Vim plugin manager called [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim).

It's simple and doesn't have all the overhead of some of the other Vim plugin managers/pref bundles.

I'm only using a small handful of plugins (shown below)

```
Bundle 'SuperTab'

" Repos from GitHub
Bundle 'bling/vim-airline'
Bundle 'tpope/vim-fugitive'
Bundle 'davidhalter/jedi-vim'
Bundle 'rodjek/vim-puppet'
Bundle 'elzr/vim-json'

" installed bundles go here
Bundle 'Syntastic'
```

Vundle has been going through some upgrades lately which is making it even easier to use.

Take 10 minutes and check it out.
